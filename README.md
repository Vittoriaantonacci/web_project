- A web server (e.g. Apache)
- A relational DBMS (e.g. MariaDB or MySql)
- Composer (for "composer include")

***Note:*** xampp includes php, web server and MySql, but having php on your device added to PATH is recommended. <br>
To install compose, follow the easy to use guide on official website: <br>
https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-macos


### 1. Download source code

```bash
composer install
```

### Extra:   for local server

Using a local server (for instance, localhost) requires quite more steps:

- Comment lines 21-22-23 of the file '.htaccess' to turn off https redirect: some browsers gave unhandled certificate error. If you want https anyway, you should consent "Proceed Anyway" on browser settings;

- If you have unix like OS (linux, macOS...) grant Apache permission to read and write in the following directories: 
    - /recipeek/var/proxies  (if not exists create it)
    - /recipeek/smarty/libs/template_c
    - /recipeek/public/default
    - /recipeek/public/uploads/* (all folders in uploads)

To do that, open terminal on each of this folder and type:

```bash
sudo chmod -R 755 $(pwd)
```
